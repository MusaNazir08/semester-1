# You should store the sequence in an appropriate data structure named 'sequence'


# You may wish to use further output for testing purposes while you develop your code

[print(item) for item in sequence]    # this method is reasonably independent of the choice of data structure

# The web page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recam%C3%A1n%27s_sequence shows about 80 numbers in the sequence
